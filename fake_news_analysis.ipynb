He knows everything else, right? Exactly. Trump spend his entire presidential campaign acting like he knew more than everyone else, and even remarked that he knew  more than the generals  do about ISIS. Now more than ever, Trump has proven that his statements were complete lies   and this fiasco with General Flynn exposes it perfectly. If Trump had known everything, he would have known that Flynn was speaking with Russian officials and that Flynn had lied to VP Mike Pence about his communications with Russia.Behar was hardly the only host on The View who wanted to say something about it   co-hosts Jedediah Bila and Whoopi Goldberg jumped at the chance to weigh in. Bila slammed Trump and his team for being so reckless with their appointments and for dropping the ball. She said: There s no way that he didn t know about it. Everyone went and said,  Look, this could potentially compromise our national security because this guy may potentially get bribed.  Then what happens? Kellyanne Conway has the responsibility to be informed. This is falling on the heels of her having that huge controversy promoting Ivanka [Trump] s line and now she s out there talking about,  I didn t know.  No, it s your job to know and it s Donald Trump s job to know. If there is someone in your administration that could potentially jeopardize our national security, that becomes our problem and it s your job to protect us. That s your one job! Goldberg also shredded Trump, stating that this is what happens when highly problematic, unqualified people are put in positions  just to piss people off. The entire show was filled with sarcasm and shots directed at Trump and his administration. This was one of The View s best anti-Trump segments, and you can watch the hosts go off on our should-be-impeached president below:Featured image via screenshot and Steve Pope / Getty Images\",\n          \" The greatest love affair in the history of the American Presidency.  -Charlton HestonTo learn more about Young Americans Foundation go here: yaf.org\",\n          \"GAZA (Reuters) - The new chief of Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, arrived in Cairo on Saturday to hold talks with senior Egyptian officials about the blockade of Gaza on his first such visit as leader, a Hamas spokesman said. In the past few months Hamas has sought to mend relations with Egypt, which controls their one international border crossing from the Gaza Strip. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been wary of ties between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, ousted from power by Sisi after mass protests.     Hamas controls the Gaza Strip, a densely populated coastal territory that shares borders with Egypt and Israel, with which it has fought three wars since 2008.  For much of the last decade, Egypt has joined Israel in enforcing a partial land, sea and air blockade of Gaza. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the talks with Egypt will focus on alleviating the blockade and mending a longstanding rift with rival group Fatah, headed by Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. An Egyptian source confirmed Haniyeh s arrival with a delegation for talks on the border crossing, security and power supplies. Haniyeh was elected Hamas leader in May. The group maintains a sizeable armed wing in Gaza since seizing the enclave from Fatah in 2007. Hoping to pressure Hamas to relinquish control of Gaza, Abbas has cut payments to Israel for the electricity it supplies to Gaza. This means that electricity has often been provided for less than four hours a day, and never more than six. Abbas has vowed to keep up sanctions against Gaza, saying measures are aimed against Hamas and not ordinary people. In turn, Hamas is trying to make a crack in the wall of sanctions by improving its relations with Egypt and other Arab countries. Israel, which signed a 1979 peace treaty with Egypt and coordinates closely with it on security, is maintaining a close watch on discussions between Egypt and Hamas. Like the United States and the European Union, it regards Hamas as a terrorist group. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"donald trump and his incompetent corrupt team got their aes handed to them today on the view following the massive controversy surrounding the resignation of general mike flynn from his role as national security advisor last nightthis was a topic that cohost joy behar could not wait to get into as she ripped into trump and sarcastically said what most of us have been thinking about the flynn situation i thought he knew more than the generals he knows everything else right exactly trump spend his entire presidential campaign acting like he knew more than everyone else and even remarked that he knew more than the generals do about isis now more than ever trump has proven that his statements were complete lies and this fiasco with general flynn exposes it perfectly if trump had known everything he would have known that flynn was speaking with russian officials and that flynn had lied to vp mike pence about his communications with russiabehar was hardly the only host on the view who wanted to say something about it cohosts jedediah bila and whoopi goldberg jumped at the chance to weigh in bila slammed trump and his team for being so reckless with their appointments and for dropping the ball she said there s no way that he didn t know about it everyone went and said look this could potentially compromise our national security because this guy may potentially get bribed then what happens kellyanne conway has the responsibility to be informed this is falling on the heels of her having that huge controversy promoting ivanka trump s line and now she s out there talking about i didn t know no it s your job to know and it s donald trump s job to know if there is someone in your administration that could potentially jeopardize our national security that becomes our problem and it s your job to protect us that s your one job goldberg also shredded trump stating that this is what happens when highly problematic unqualified people are put in positions just to piss people off the entire show was filled with sarcasm and shots directed at trump and his administration this was one of the view s best antitrump segments and you can watch the hosts go off on our shouldbeimpeached president belowfeatured image via screenshot and steve pope getty images\",\n          \"the greatest love affair in the history of the american presidency charlton hestonto learn more about young americans foundation go here yaforg\",\n          \"gaza reuters the new chief of palestinian islamist group hamas ismail haniyeh arrived in cairo on saturday to hold talks with senior egyptian officials about the blockade of gaza on his first such visit as leader a hamas spokesman said in the past few months hamas has sought to mend relations with egypt which controls their one international border crossing from the gaza strip egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi has been wary of ties between hamas and the muslim brotherhood ousted from power by sisi after mass protests hamas controls the gaza strip a densely populated coastal territory that shares borders with egypt and israel with which it has fought three wars since for much of the last decade egypt has joined israel in enforcing a partial land sea and air blockade of gaza hamas spokesman fawzi barhoum said the talks with egypt will focus on alleviating the blockade and mending a longstanding rift with rival group fatah headed by westernbacked palestinian president mahmoud abbas an egyptian source confirmed haniyeh s arrival with a delegation for talks on the border crossing security and power supplies haniyeh was elected hamas leader in may the group maintains a sizeable armed wing in gaza since seizing the enclave from fatah in hoping to pressure hamas to relinquish control of gaza abbas has cut payments to israel for the electricity it supplies to gaza this means that electricity has often been provided for less than four hours a day and never more than six abbas has vowed to keep up sanctions against gaza saying measures are aimed against hamas and not ordinary people in turn hamas is trying to make a crack in the wall of sanctions by improving its relations with egypt and other arab countries israel which signed a peace treaty with egypt and coordinates closely with it on security is maintaining a close watch on discussions between egypt and hamas like the united states and the european union it regards hamas as a terrorist group\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
